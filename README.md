Summary
The Human Crack Game is a program that allows the user to play a word unscrambling game. The program generates a random word from a pre-defined list, shuffles the letters, and prompts the user to guess the original word. The user has 3 attempts to guess the word correctly. If the user exhausts all attempts, the program will reveal the correct word and give the option to play again. The program also has a Main Menu that gives the user the option to start the game or read the game description.

Breakthrough Moment
A breakthrough moment in the development of this program was when I implemented a recursive function to allow the user to play the game again after each round. This was a new concept for me and required some research and experimentation. I had to learn how to properly use the return statement and call the function within itself. This added an extra layer of functionality to the program and made it more engaging for the user.

Data Abstraction
In this program, data abstraction is used to store and retrieve the pre-defined list of words that are used in the game. The following code segment shows where the data is being stored:

Copy code
words = ["python", "programming", "language", "computer", "science"]
The data is retrieved and used in the generate_word() function, as shown in this code segment:

Copy code
def generate_word():
    return random.choice(words)
This abstraction represents the list of words that are used in the game. By storing the list of words separately from the rest of the program code, it allows for easy modification and customization of the game without having to make changes throughout the entire program. This abstraction also makes the code more organized and easier to read.

Procedural Abstraction
In this program, procedural abstraction is used in the play_game() function. The function takes no parameters and includes an algorithm that uses sequencing, selection, and iteration. The function generates a random word, shuffles the letters, and prompts the user for a guess. The function then uses the check_guess() function to check if the user's guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the user is congratulated and the game ends. If the guess is incorrect, the user is prompted to try again. This process repeats until the user either correctly guesses the word or exhausts all attempts. The function also includes a play_again loop that allows the user to play the game again after each round.

This function is important for the purpose of the program as it is the core gameplay of the Human Crack Game. By encapsulating all of the game logic into a single function, it makes the program more organized and easier to understand. The function also allows for easy modification and customization of the game without having to make changes throughout the entire program. Additionally, the use of a separate function for the guessing logic allows for easy expansion and addition of new features to the game.

The procedural abstraction helps to manage complexity in the program by breaking down the program into smaller, more manageable chunks. It allows for the separation of the game logic from the user input and output, making the program easier to understand and modify. Additionally, by using a separate function for the guessing logic, it makes it easy to expand and add new features to the game without having to make changes to the entire program.
